Over the course of a research project, many datasets could be used or generated, and sometimes it's tricky to effectively document each dataset with its own data dictionary and to comprehensively trace data lineage. With [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), the data lineage part can be done manually, but with many datasets it can be cumbersome to define a target for each part in the data transformation process. `blueprintr` creates a project structure that builds into or modifies existing `drake` plans automatically.
